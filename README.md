Energy communities
An energy community is an association of at least two participants for the joint production and utilization of energy. There are community producers and users and grid producers and users. You should write a system, consisting of multiple components, that shows the current energy distribution and usage.

Idea
In the center of the system is a message queue that receives energy production and usage messages. Based on these updates, a service should calculate the current community and grid usages. If a community user wants energy, the community energy pool will be used first. Otherwise the grid will deliver the energy. 

After the usage is calculated, another service calculates the percentage for the current hour based on the usage.

You can monitor the current distribution of energy on a Graphical User Interface (GUI). You can also ask for historical data.

Components
You have to develop 6 components for this project. Every component is its own application that can be started independently form the other applications.

Community Energy Producer
A community energy producer sends the following message to the queue:

type: PRODUCER
association: COMMUNITY
kwh: the kWh produced in a minute (e.g. 0.003)
datetime: the datetime of the energy production (e.g. 2025-01-10T14:33:00)
The Energy Producer should send a message every couple of seconds with a semi random (but plausible) amount of kWh. Incorporate a Weather API to make sure more energy is produced when the sun is shining. It is up to you to decide on the concrete Weather API to use, some examples include https://openweathermap.org/ and https://open-meteo.com/

Community Energy User
A energy user sends the following message to the queue:

type: USER
association: COMMUNITY
kwh: the kWh used in a minute (e.g. 0.001)
datetime: the datetime of the energy usage (e.g. 2025-01-10T14:34:00)
The Energy User should send a message every couple of seconds with a semi random (but plausible) amount of kWh. Incorporate the time of day to make sure more energy is needed in peak hours in the morning and in the evening.

Usage Service
Every time a new PRODUCER or USER messages comes in, the database is updated. The data from individual minutes is accumulated into the corresponding hours, e.g.:

Database table before the new USER message:

hour	community_produced	community_used	grid_used
2025-01-10T14:00:00	18.05	18.02	1.056
2025-01-10T13:00:00	15.015	14.033	2.049

A new messages is processed by the queue:

type: USER
association: COMMUNITY
kwh: 0.05
datetime: 2025-01-10T14:34:00
Database table after the message:

hour	community_produced	community_used	grid_used
2025-01-10T14:00:00	18.05	18.05	1.076
2025-01-10T13:00:00	15.015	14.033	2.049
As the community user required more energy than was available in the community production pool, grid usage also increased. Note: community_used can never be greater than community_produced. From the 0.05, 0.03 are taken from the community and 0.02 are taken from the grid.

Current Percentage Service
Because the usage changed, a new percentage has to be calculated.

hour	community_depleted	grid_portion
2025-01-10T14:00:00	100.00	5.63
This means the community pool is 100% depleted and the grid portion of the total energy (community_used + grid_used) was 5.63% . The table only holds the information of the current hour.

GUI
This information needs to be displayed somewhere. Use JavaFX to create a GUI that can display the current percentage data and historical data based on a time filter.



Important: The GUI is not directly connected to the database. The GUI uses a REST API to fetch the data.

REST API
Use Spring Boot to create a REST API with two endpoints:

GET /energy/current
returns the percentage of the current hour
GET /energy/historical?start=...&end=...
returns the usage date for a given time period (start to end)
The Spring Boot Application is connected to the database, but can only read the information from the tables.

Example Timeline
Community Energy Producer sends production data to queue based on the current weather
Community Energy User sends minute usage data to queue based on time of the day
Usage Service picks up the minute data and updates the hour data in the database
Usage Service sends a message to the queue that new data is available
Current Percentage Service picks up the new data and saves the calculated percentage data to the database
GUI wants to refresh the current percentage und sends a GET request to the REST API
The REST API handles the request, reads the data from the database and returns the data to the GUI
The GUI displays the data to the user
